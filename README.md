# Wrapped1
1st place winner, Capital One 2022 Software Engineering Summit Hackathon 

Worked with 6 summiteers at the 36 hour hackathon to produce Wrapped1, a first-place winning web application that uses data analytics and a user-friendly interface to promote financial literacy and budgeting-oriented conversations. Users can separate their spending into different categories to access category-specific breakdowns, as well as a monthly "wrapped" page, which features shareable insights into their spending and saving habits that month.

To access Wrapped1, go to https://wrapped1.herokuapp.com/. You should see a login page - just click sign in as there is no need to provide any information.
